## Getting Started

**How will you be using VLM?**

### [Basic Features](https://docs.vlm.gg/#/decentraland/getting-started/basic-install.md)
- I don't need to control anything via code.

### [Advanced Features](https://docs.vlm.gg/#/decentraland/getting-started/advanced-install.md)

- I want to use the advanced user features that let me design complex scenes and implement my own controls. (Must enable Advanced User role on your VLM account.)

#### **Statement of Gratitude to the Decentraland DAO**

Thanks to a grant from the Decentraland DAO,
Virtual Land Manager is able to manage Decentraland scenes at no cost.
Decentraland is one of the only metaverse platforms that is decentralized and owned by its users.
We affect how the world operates though participating in a form of decentralized governance.
VLM started as a tool for Decentraland, and wants to thank you for choosing to build here.
